            <p>
            <h3>General interests</h3>
            I love to learn, so I spend a lot of my waking hours learning new things. In the past, I've been
            particularly interested in math, philosophy, logic, computing and programming, music, film, literature, and
            the physical sciences. These days I'm thinking more and more about the really complex, modern, society-level
            problems which face ordinary people. Climate change, homelessness, and education reform are a few such
            issues. Everyone seems to have an opinion on these issues, but there seems to be a serious knowledge gap
            between academic experts, policy-makers, and citizens. <br> <br>

            I would love to help reduce this gap and support real change that helps people in my communities, so I've
            been really interested in learning more in these areas. As such, I've started reading <i>Grand Expectations:
                The United States, 1945-1974</i> by James Patterson (US history) and watching video lectures on money,
            banking, and macroeconomics. I also hope to pursue studies in public policy and organizational leadership.
            <h3>Math interests</h3>
            I've loved math since the third grade. Until my third year of college, this was because I was good at it and
            enjoyed the puzzle-solving process. Once I started taking proof-writing courses, I loved math for the same
            reason, but also because I genuinely found the subject matter interesting. <br><br>

            Nowadays, I'm doing less math and learning more about how we should teach math. If you want to know more
            about my past work in math itself, check out my math portfolio on the <a href="./cv.html">Portfolio & CV</a>
            page.
            <h3>Philosophy interests</h3>
            I got into philosophy in undergrad. The college had professors from both the analytic and continental side
            of the discipline, but I ended up falling pretty stably into the analytic side. <br> <br>

            Within that side, my interests are quite widespread: epistemology and metaphysics are my most explored
            areas, but I also love doing logic and I've really enjoyed my cursory readings in the philosophy of
            education. Recently, the journal Teaching Philosophy has accepted a paper I co-authored with my old logic
            professor on how to teach the truth table for the material conditional to introductory logic students. If
            you want to know more about my work in this field, check out my philosophy portfolio on the <a

                <h2>Academic history</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                I received my high school diploma in 2019 from Berea Community High School in Berea, Kentucky. There, I
                took as many Honors and AP courses as I could, and I really began to develop interests in a variety of
                subjects, including math, English, economics, and physics. In the end, though, math was my favorite
                subject. I have no doubt that this was in large part because of Mrs. Linda Williams, who was always
                incredibly encouraging and engaging. To this day, she still comes to mind as one of the best teachers
                I've had, and she is the main reason I am studying math now.<br> <br>

                Largely due to the financial aid I was provided, I ended up going to college at Kalamazoo College (K) in
                Kalamazoo, Michigan. In my first few terms there, I was planning on majoring in math and physics while
                taking German courses to fulfill the foreign language requirement. I ended up loving the German courses
                and professors, so I decided to major in German, too. Eventually, I lost interest in physics and
                replaced it with philosophy&mdash;and I haven't looked back since! <br> <br>

                At K, I had many instructors who played pivotol roles in my life. In the German department, I owe a
                great deal to Dr. Kathryn Sederberg, Dr. Michael Powers, and Dr. Petra Watzke for pushing everyone to
                improve while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. Along similar lines, Dr. Eric Barth and Dr. Stephen
                Oloo were integral in the development of my math education. Then, in philosophy, I owe more than 3/4 of
                my knowledge and success to Dr. Lars Enden, who is now a dear friend of mine.
