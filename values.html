            <h3>The meaning of leadership</h3>
            As I begin to switch my career path from academia to impactful organizational work, I am faced with the
            question of how to be an effective leader and follower in that context. By reading articles from <a
                href="https://info.online.bradley.edu/master-certificate-nonprofit/blog/nonprofit-leadership-skills">Bradley
                University</a>, <a href="https://causeleadership.com/insights-become-nonprofit-leader/">Cause
                Leadership</a>, and <a href="https://nla1.org/nonprofit-management-skills/">the Nonprofit Leadership
                Alliance</a>, a few characteristics of effective leadership stand out to me:
            <ol>
                <li>Drive to achieve the organization's values</li>
                <li>Interpersonal skills, such as emotional intelligence and conflict management skills</li>
                <li>Problem solving and strategic planning skills</li>
            </ol>
            At OSU, I have also learned about the meaning of leadership through Dr. Haley Traini's graduate-level
            "Leadership Skills for Career Success" course. The course covered the meaning of leadership from a variety
            of perspectives, and it informed my view of leadership in one major way: <b>there is a difference between
                leadership and authority.</b> As described in <a
                href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/5764-PDF-ENG?Ntt=the%20practice%20of%20adaptive%20leadership"><i>The
                    Practice of Adaptive Leadership</i></a>, we get authority when people trust us to effectively do our
            job and pursue the organization's goals. But you can be an authority figure without actually pursuing
            change, collaborating with others, and experimenting. In this light, leadership is less of a job and more of
            a practice in which people are mobilized to help the organization thrive. <br> <br>

            Effective leadership also requires effective followership. In <a
                href="https://www.bkconnection.com/books/title/the-courageous-follower"><i>The Courageous
                    Follower</i></a>, Ira Chaleff argues that we can't see the role of a follower as a docile
            conformist. Followership, like leadership, is a collaborative practice in pursuit of the organization's
            purpose. Courageous followers assume responsibility for themselves and the organization and seek out
            opportunities to fulfill their potential. All-in-all, followership goes hand-in-hand with leadership, and I
            want to be able to effectively play both roles.
            <h3>My strengths</h3>
            In Dr. Traini's leadership course, I tested my ability in a variety of different leadership skills and
            identified several strengths:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Followership.</b> One unit of the course was focused on followership. In addition to reading
                    excerpts of <i>The Courageous Follower</i>, I completed the followership self-assessment provided in
                    <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ctq4cZS5JfsC&printsec=copyright#v=onepage&q&f=false"><i>Leadership:
                            Theory and Practice</i></a>. These reflective activities indicated that I'm an effective
                    follower. My background in philosophy has especially helped with independent thinking, as one of the
                    main skills that philosophy aims to impart is the ability to understand and evaluate different
                    perspectives or arguments.
                </li>
                <li><b>Systems thinking.</b> Another unit of the course focused on systems thinking, a perspective that
                    takes a big-picture, holistic view of systemic challenges. I had already begun thinking about
                    systemic change in the context of my research in mathematics education, so I chose to push myself in
                    this area in particular. As a result, I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses in systems
                    thinking. This is showcased in an <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1-X3-YFsLlr1JycITBfMnT8SHd92wkyWSvsNe8euLs/edit?usp=sharing">application
                        assignment</a> in which I reflect on my proficiency with the <a
                        href="https://thinkingtoolsstudio.waterscenterst.org/cards">14 Habits of a Systems Thinker</a>.
                    I then continued to research different systems thinking frameworks and ultimately held a 30-minute
                    workshop on leading for systemic change using the Above and Below the Line (ABLe) change framework.
                    You can find a copy of that workshop <a
                        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLMRI4g6iLj6Hkw2925TMivSf4QUyECm/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>,
                    and you can find my reflection on the workshop <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ym07uCozoxhC_oM4t7pm7FlKtj6ZJIMr9L6DvtGwxSM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My growth areas</h3>
            The leadership course also highlighted several growth areas for my skills as a leader and follower:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Conflict management.</b> The course included a unit on conflict management, including reading
                    excerpts on <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Crucial_Conversations_Tools_for_Talking/VhkQpRH9D9gC?hl=en&gbpv=0"><i>Crucial
                            Conversations</i></a>. I have always been challenged by conflict management, particularly
                    because I tend to lean towards a "competing" style of conflict management instead of a healthier and
                    more effective collaborating style. Luckily, the reading
                    for the course highlighted specific areas where I could improve. I go into more depth in a <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XaDmAnAqLJQubUMBJVUixhxx9_x31KON/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110827380388982990267&rtpof=true&sd=true">conflict
                        management assessment</a> I completed for the course.</li>
                <li><b>Lack of experience.</b> While the course involved a lot of reading and reflection, I am lacking
                    in direct experience working as a leader and follower in impactful organizational contexts. In
                    short, the course taught me more about my strengths and weaknesses, but I need more authentic
                    practice in order to develop my skills even further. So, moving forward, I plan on puruing more
                    experiences where I can learn by doing, keeping the insights Dr. Traini gave me in mind in order to
                    keep developing towards my maximum potential.</li>
