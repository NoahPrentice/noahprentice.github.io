                graduate student and graduate teaching assistant at Oregon State University. My most recent CV (updated
                5/4/2025) reflects this work:

            <h3>Broad takeaways</h3>
            Outside of schoolwork, I have mostly worked on project management and community engagement. This kind of
            work aligns with one of my core values: intentionally-designed projects and systems which have a real impact
            on my community, especially those with unmet needs. My experiences have given me a few vital skills:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Collaboration and teamwork.</b> I see collaboration as immensely important. There are many worthy
                    goals that are too ambitious for any one person, so we need to work together to achieve them.
                    Sometimes this means playing smaller roles that serve the bigger picture, and sometimes this means
                    taking initiative and playing leadership roles. In the next section, I lay out my
                    experience doing both kinds of work, but both small and large roles require effective
                    communication, so that has become my most-valued skill. I talk more about this in my <a
                        href="#philosophyPortfolio">philosophy portfolio</a>. <br>
                    <br>

                    Another major part of teamwork is diversity and inclusion. There is monumental value in hearing
                    different perspectives on the same topic, so I believe that organizations and projects should go out
                    of their way to include a wide variety of people and perspectives in their work. Instead of viewing
                    differences as roadblocks, I use them as opportunities for open-mindedness and progress.
                    You can read more about my thoughts on this in my <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-CbCemt-UItMrspdQeGqFIw-G9pRWebQKOVIzYdb6Q/edit?usp=sharing"
                        target="_blank">DEI
                        statement</a>.
                </li> <br>
                <li><b>Organization of resources and people.</b> The impact of a project is dependent on the available
                    resources and people, and I've seen many projects suffer as a result of misorganizing its resources.
                    To address this on the individual level, I work really hard on organizing time, data, and people so
                    that people trust me to get effective work done on my own.<br>
                    <br>

                    But effectively using resources and people also involves holistic, detail-oriented thinking: What
                    systems should we put in place to avoid making costly mistakes? If we have different teams working
                    on the same project in different ways, how do we combine their results and avoid miscommunication?
                    The structure of a project or organization should be built on the answers to these questions.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Iteration, data, and community.</b> Projects are founded on the goals they want to accomplish. As
                    such, I have a very results-oriented approach to project management. But fully accomplishing all of
                    our goals requires learning from our mistakes and improving in the future. This iterative process
                    requires lots of feedback, so I work hard on gathering and analyzing data to provide guidance for
                    future action. I discuss this more in my <a href="#mathPortfolio">math portfolio</a>. <br> <br>

                    When a project is dedicated to serving a group of clients, gathering and analyzing data relies on
                    building mutual trust, maintaining a sense of community, and understanding their values,
                    backgrounds, and perspectives. It frankly does no good to view communities as helpless, predictable,
                    and ignorant of the "real problems," so I work on building healthy partnerships with clients that
                    let us solve the problems together. Again, diversity, equity, and inclusion are really important for
                    this. Read more about that in my <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-CbCemt-UItMrspdQeGqFIw-G9pRWebQKOVIzYdb6Q/edit?usp=sharing"

                    <h2>CAPS</h2> Kalamazoo College's Center of Civic Engagement has a program called Community
                    Advocates for Parents and Students, or CAPS. CAPS is a grassroots, all-volunteer community
                    organization that provides tutoring opportunities for Kalamazoo Public School students who live in
                    low-income housing. I worked with CAPS during the 2019-2020 school year, during which time I
                    <ul>
                        <li>created a welcoming learning environment where the students felt interested in learning,
                        </li>
                        <li>helped students of all ages complete their schoolwork, focusing on literacy and math skills,
                        </li>
                        <li>talked with students about school, college, and their relationships to other people.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This experience taught
                    me how a student's socioeconomic conditions and daily life impact their ability to learn in a
                    classroom or tutoring center, and it challenged me to connect what the students were learning to
                    their lives. It also challenged me to encourage and empower the students so that they believed that
                    they could excel in school and become the grown-up, successful college students who tutored them.

                    <h2>RA and SRA</h2> At Kalamazoo College, I worked for 2.5 years as a Residential Assistant (RA) or
                    Senior Residential Assistant (SRA). In this role, I
                    <ul>
                        <li>managed RAs for 2 residence halls and coordinate action related to community programming,
                            emergency response, student outreach, and more,</li>
                        <li>worked with 6 other RAs to mentor 220 residents on adapting to college life, and</li>
                        <li>led programs in collaboration with several college departments and several of the 96
                            student organizations to give residents useful information and enjoyable activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    As you can see, this was a very collaborative role. The RAs' goals of community-building and safety
                    took lots of teamwork, and hearing a wide variety of opinions. The experience taught me a lot about
                    working in a large team which included the College's professional staff with lots of decision-making
                    responsibility, other SRAs with some decision-making responsibility, and RAs with a little
                    decision-making responsibility.

                    <h2>SIP and MPC</h2> At Kalamazoo College, I worked with the Math and Physics Center (MPC) as an
                    assistant to the center. In this role, I
                    <ul>
                        <li>managed and advised the consultants working in the center, organized their activities, and
                            scheduled meetings with the consultants and the director of the learning centers,</li>
                        <li>spoke to consultants who worked at the collected and utilized feedback on tutoring
                            resources, and</li>
                        <li>advised students on handling courses and departments</li>
                    </ul>
                    Similar to serving as an SRA, my work with the MPC relied on being able to effectively organize
                    people and data while coordinating with the supervisors or administrators who ran the center. <br>
                    <br>

                    I also completed my Senior Integrated Project (SIP) in coordination with the MPC: I developed a
                    system of videos and written documents that were accessible primarily through the MPC, since the
                    physical documents were housed there and the digital materials were housed on an MPC channel for
                    Microsoft Teams. In addition to developing the learning materials themselves, I developed the system
                    which allows others to contribute materials of their own. The system comprised written documents and
                    videos which explain the solution process for various Calculus problems, and you can find these on
                    <a href="https://github.com/NoahPrentice/Capstone">my GitHub "Capstone" repository</a>.

                    <h2>CGE</h2> At Oregon State University, I joined the Organizing Team for the Coalition of Graduate
                    Employees (CGE), the graduate student labor union, at the beginning of a strike. In this role, I
                    served the union in any way
                    it needed, including
                    <ul>
                        <li>getting feedback on the strike and union actions from other graduate students through office
                            visits, the math department town hall, and phone-banking,</li>
                        <li>helping community members understand or navigate the leadership's direct actions,
                            instructions, and goals, and</li>
                        <li>moving organizing materials and checking people into the picket line on a daily basis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    While this role did not come with many leadership responsibilities, it was enlightening to see
                    behind-the-scenes at a small, grassroots organization made up of the very community members
                    it aims to serve. It also gave me direct experience working in a "flat" organization, where everyone
                    has the same amount of power despite different amounts of responsibility.<br> <br>

                    Since the strike has ended, I have switched roles and joined the Membership Committee, which is
                    aimed at building community, power, and solidarity among the graduate students. Currently, I am
                    trying to help departments organize town halls so that their graduate students have a place to make
                    connections, get information, and receive support in any other way they might need.

            <h3>Broad takeaways</h3>
            Look, I know a lot of math. So, if you find a bunch of different simply connected topological spaces and you
            need someone to compute their fundamental groups, I'm your guy.<sup>*</sup> But studying math has given me
            skills that are more broadly applicable to my life. Here are my main takeaways:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Understanding numbers and models.</b> My math background includes a variety of applied areas such
                    as probability, statistics and data science, and differential equations. In these areas, success is
                    determined by how well you understand the numbers or models you've been given. What does the data
                    mean? How does this equation model the housing consumption of a family? Getting answers to these
                    questions can take some pretty sophisticated analysis, but the results yield insight into what the
                    data actually says and how to approach the problem in the first place.</li> <br>
                <li><b>Logical problem-solving.</b> Learning math is best done by <i>doing</i> math, and that means
                    solving <i>a lot</i> of problems. Math is also an extension of logic, so that means solving problems
                    precisely, clearly, and carefully. This is not an irrelevant skill. Breaking down a problem into
                    pieces, considering each tool in your arsenal, and thinking carefully about the perceived
                    roadblocks, are all crucial parts of solving any problem.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h3>Projects and research</h3>
            I am just beginning the process of moving away from coursework and into research with my advisor, Dr.
            Malgorzata Peszynska. My work is in numerical analysis, particularly as it relates to partial differential
            equations. Some examples of my work are shown below. Click a caption to see a full PDF.

            <h3>Broad takeaways</h3>
            Philosophy gets a bad rap. Many people think that people who "discuss philosophy" just end up talking in
            circles, not making any progress. There's some truth to this, but there are a few helpful things I've picked
            up over the years:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clear communication.</b> Because it's so easy to misunderstand one-another, philosophy cares a
                    lot about clarity. For example, let's say you and I are talking about exams and we agree that "exams
                    suck and should be improved." Even if we agree on that slogan, we might <i>disagree</i> on very
                    important details: What sucks about the exams? Do they suck for students, teachers, or
                    administrators? Does the type or format of the exam matter? If we don't agree on these details,
                    working towards a solution that satisfies both of us might be impossible. <br> <br>

                    The most important example of clear, philosophical communication is talking about arguments and
                    reasons. If you think that exams suck and your friend thinks that exams are great, then both of you
                    should clearly lay out your reasoning:

                    <div id="reasoningDiv">
                        <div class="arg">
                            <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Premise.</b> Graded exams enforce a system where success is solving problems
                                    without external resources like the internet.</li>
                                <li><b>Premise.</b> In the real world, successfully solving problems involves resources
                                    like the internet. </li>
                                <li><b>Conclusion.</b> Therefore, exams enforce a misguided idea of success, which is
                                    bad. </li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="arg">
                            <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Premise.</b> Exams measure how much a student understands the material. </li>
                                <li><b>Premise.</b> We want successful students to understand the material. </li>
                                <li><b>Conclusion.</b> Therefore, exams measure a valuable component of success, which
                                    is good. </li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    When our reasons are laid out this clearly, we can make progress by turning disagreements over the
                    conclusion into disagreements over the premises. Hopefully, this lets us eventually get to a
                    solution that everyone is happy with.
                </li> <br>
                <li><b>Critical thinking.</b> Critical thinking involves identifying problems, analysing the problem to
                    find the root cause, and coming up with solutions that effectively solve the problem. It also
                    involves values of open-mindedness, honesty, and humility. When discussing exams, I might realize
                    that there's a problem with exams I hadn't considered, or maybe my proposed solution had a fatal
                    error I was ignoring. If I really care about improving exams, I have to be able to identify problems
                    even when that means admitting I was wrong.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Papers</h3>
            I've practiced communication and critical thinking mostly by writing papers. Here are a few topics I've
            written about!
            </p>
            <div class="paperRow">
                <div class="paperElt">
                    <p><b>What's the deal with implications?</b> I have co-authored a paper with Dr. Lars Enden on
                        teaching introductory logic. In formal logic, there's a relation that represents "if...,
                        then..." statements, and it behaves counterintuitively. Lars and I argue that the usual ways of
                        teaching this relation are bad, and we present a better one. <a href="/pdfs/Horseshoe_Paper.pdf"

                    <p><b>Are brains just computers?</b> One area of philosophy, metaphysics, contains the philosophy of
                        mind. This field asks questions like "do we have souls?" and "what is consciousness?" I discuss
                        the question of whether we could be conscious as just a bunch of atoms grouped together in a
                        brain&mdash;no soul necessary. <a href="/pdfs/556_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to read

                    <p><b>How does art... work?</b> A vast region of philosophy is dedicated to understanding symbols
                        like words, sentences, and images. Philosophy of art falls into this category. I examine one
                        perspective on how art works and relate it to an art piece from the Kalamazoo Institute of Art.

                    <p><b>If God exists, why do bad things happen to good people?</b> You know, there's been a lot of
                        fighting as a result of religion. So, I'm just gonna go ahead and solve all of the problems and
                        make everyone happy. It feels like nobody else is going to do it, so I might as well give it a
                        shot! This was my first philosophy paper. I wrote it for my favorite class I've ever taken: a
                        seminar taught by Dr. Lars Enden. <a href="/pdfs/Evil_Paper.docx.pdf" target="_blank">Click here

                In addition to these papers, I've done extensive reading in the philosophy of science,
                epistemology, and&mdash;my favorite&mdash;the philosophy of education. I also worked through every
                exercise in <i>Mathematical Logic Through Python</i> by Yannai A. Gonczarowski and Noam Nisan, which was
                very fun. You can see the result of that work at <a href="https://github.com/NoahPrentice/logic">this
                    GitHub repository</a>.
            <h3>Coursework and reading.</h3>
            My coursework and reading has covered informal, formal, and mathematical logic, epistemology, metaphysics
            and the philosophy of mind, metametaphysics and ontology, art, language, education, and more. If you want
